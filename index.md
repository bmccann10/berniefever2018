## Theoretical Overview

Hailed  as “the third age of political communication” (Larsson, 2014), the Internet is playing an increasingly significant role in politics across the world.  The latest US Presidential elections and the Brexit vote, have demonstrated how non-direct interests can manipulate the political conversation, particularly through Facebook.  But how do political figures themselves stimulate and influence public conversation through their own Facebook pages?

Political leaders use social media for both transparency and outreach (Aharony, 2012; Steinfeld, 2016).  Most studies have focused on social media use during campaigning or by political leaders in office.  However, less work has been done on the way in which opposition leaders use social media to build support.  The benefit of social media is that it offers political leaders a channel of communication that is not filtered by national or local media and therefore conveys unique agendas without censorship or filtering.  In this sense, it particularly serves politicians in opposition.   (Steinfeld, 2016)

Despite the revolutionary promise of social media to transform political debate and re-engage citizens, the Internet has enhanced existing behavioural patterns, broadcasting rather than stimulating dialogue (Sorensen, 2016; Carlisle & Parron, 2013; Fenoll & Cano-Orón, 2017).  Similarly, social media can favour ideological polarisation through the much-cited echo-chamber effect.          

Studies have tended to focus, therefore, on either the posts (identifying typographies or comparing activity across different leaders) or the dynamics of political conversations but less often combining both.  One exception found that participation and interaction amongst followers increases, the more negative the sentiment of the original post. (Fenoll & Cano-Orón, 2017).  This somewhat contradicts sociological studies of online behaviour which have found that positive emotions tend to spread more easily than negative emotions amongst groups of social media users (Ferrara & Yang, 2015).

Sentiment analysis of Facebook activity is common but fewer studies have applied this to political interactions online.  One exception, considering the online behaviours of local government representatives in Germany, found that neutrality dominated both comments and posts but that among those exhibiting emotional content, positive emotions were more common (Hoffman, 2013).

This study therefore contributes to the current literature on Facebook use by political leaders in several ways. Firstly, by isolating the study to one political figure and adopting topic-based as opposed to typographical analysis, we can gain deeper insight as to how a political opposition leader contributes to the national political conversation.  Secondly, by combining an analysis of both posts and comments we can identify the different ways in which users interact with and respond to certain topics.  Finally, considering the comments also allows us to investigate the levels of emotion and the presence of emotional contagion in online political debate.
