# Limitations and Future Research

## Limitations 

Three key limitations to our research should be highlighted:

1.  We only examined a relatively short time frame. What we can say about post topics and the sentiments they elicit more generally is thus limited.     

2. The Cortext algorithm had some issues assigning scores. Not that many comments were actually in the neutral -1 to 1 bracket (see Figure 7).

3.  It is difficult to know what the sentiment scores actually capture as peopleâ€™s comments may respond to the topic, to the specific post content or to Bernie Sanders himself

## Future Research

There are many ways in which this research could be taken a step further:

1.   Introduce a third variable: By coding the posts by format (video, link, article, post, image etc.) or by a typology (controversial statement; informational statement, question; call to action etc.) we could consider the influence of post format on emotional content in the posts. 

2.   Introduce a comparative element: By applying the same methodology to other political figure(s) we would have a clearer understanding as to whether conversations and comments around political content on Facebook exist in the same manner irrespective of political alignment.

3.   Introduce sentiment analysis of posts: By conducting a sentiment analysis of the posts we could being to investigate the existence of emotional mirroring between posts and comments.
